# Financial-Robo-Advisor
Have you ever wondered how you could make the riskiest possible portfolio that had a ridiculous amount of movement? Probably not (unless you were a risk-loving, adrenaline-hungry investor), but this robo-advisor uses an array of statistical measures to develop an incredibly unsafe portfolio to answer this fun question. As a culmination of the CFM101 class, a Python based Robo-Advisor was created to produce a portfolio that would see the most movement over a long period of time. 

As the world grows closer together, just about every asset can be related to another in some capacity. As such, a correlation of zero is next to impossible to occur between two securities, for which statistical analysis and Monte Carlo methods could be used to determine the relationships between various different stocks. Enter our patented Robo-Advisor to view how factor analysis, volatility trading methods and various other strategies learned in CFM101 were applied to a group of random stocks to produce the riskiest possible portfolio.
