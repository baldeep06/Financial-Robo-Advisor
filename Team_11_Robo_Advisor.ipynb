    "As a culmination of CFM101, we were challenged to create a portfolio. A portfolio that could be either the riskiest or safest. In the real world, just about every experienced investor would be interested in a safe portfolio, where positive returns would not only be probable, but expected. We, on the other hand, had a different vision in mind. We created the riskiest possible portfolio, given our $750 000 starting investment, with the hopes of either losing as much money as possible, or gaining as much money as possible, and thus see the most possible movement, after five days, over. With this, we are creating a robo-advisor that would most certainly be just about the most counter-intuitive portfolio-building financial advisor, but it will be a robo-advisor, nevertheless. Join us on our process to create our fantastic robo-advisor!\n"

    "Having generated sample portfolios dependent on a combination of the stocks with the highest standard deviation, and tickers with the highest correlation, we noticed that the generated portfolios with the highest percentage returns had relatively lower standard deviations. This likely reflects highly correlated stocks, as since highly correlated stocks move similarly, the overall portfolio standard deviation would be low, while still producing high average portfolio percent returns as seen in the graph. Taking the stocks that had the highest standard deviations, we then applied our correlation function to see which stocks trended relatively similarly. If we had simply implemented a portfolio that had the stocks strictly with the highest standard deviations, it would be probable that certain stocks would trend in opposite directions, the portfolio would be diversified and as such, it would be safe, and not generate the drastic returns we desired. As such, due to correlation, it appears reasonable that our most successful portfolios, in terms of average weekly returns, have lower standard deviations, and highly correlated stocks.\n"

    "In programming our robo-advisor which created a portfolio with the most drastic possible changes in total portfolio value, we utilized the best of our knowledge gained from our CFM classes, external research, trial and error and sheer toil. We used several statistical measures to optimize our portfolio in the manner we wanted, including the Standard Deviation, Beta, Covariance, Correlation and other factors. Ultimately we were able to create a robo-advisor that generated the riskiest weighted portfolio that covered all of our restrictions. This project was not easy, with it challenging our knowledge of key finance concepts, our expertise on the math and statistics behind securities and our programming abilities, but ultimately we were able to create a product that we were satisfied with, a product that should produce the portfolio that wins on December 4th! We thank Professor Thompson, the TAs and everyone that went into creating and planning this difficult, yet fulfilling course, and hope you understand and appreciate the process that went into creating our robo-advisor.\n"
